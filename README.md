# C-_classes_stack_pointers_Exmp
Example of C++ for school project involving classes, stack and pointers. The code was originally three separate files that would combine together to run.
The first was the header, second was support page, third was the main code file. 
Some of the code was provided by our professor which are the first two classes in the header file, token and token reader.  
Rest should have been typed by me. Notes help describe what was going on.
